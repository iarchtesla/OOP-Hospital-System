# Vitalis Cura Hospital Management System 🏥

A collaborative Python OOP project simulating a hospital management system with role-based access and a modern GUI.

## Purpose
- Demonstrate OOP principles (encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, abstraction) in a real-world application.
- Provide a scalable, maintainable codebase for managing hospital workflows.
- Serve as a portfolio piece showcasing Python GUI development and data persistence.

**Note**: This is a forked and collaborative effort from the original by CommanderX0 – explore, fork, and contribute! 😊

## Key Features
- Role-based access: Admin, Doctor, Nurse, Receptionist.
- Management of patients, doctors, medicines, and appointments.
- Data persistence using JSON files.
- Modern desktop GUI built with CustomTkinter.

Project organized into key modules:

- /main.py (entry point)
- /gui (GUI components and windows)
- /models (OOP classes for users, patients, etc.)
- /data (JSON handling and persistence)
- /utils (helper functions)

(More details in code comments)
